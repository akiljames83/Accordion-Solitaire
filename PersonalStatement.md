## Personal Statement

**Prompt:**
What impact do you want to have on the world and why? Please limit your statement to 500 words maximum and provide your submission with a link.

**Answer:** 

For many years, I have had a great interest in both the Medical Field as well as the Computer Science Field. Upon entering college, I was given a unique opportunity to pursue both of these passions in a new dual-degree program at my school. Thus far, it has allowed me to gain insights into both what is capable in the Software Engineering Field but also the stark juxtaposition in the amount of technological innovation lacking in the medical industry.

The impact I want to leave on this world is to bridge that gap! So far in college I have created quite a few projects that have helped me approach this goal such as: Write Ai-d and Checkup. Write Ai-d was a machine learning algorithm that could decipher messy handwriting of a client with a spastic hand condition (Primary General Dystonia), allowing her to efficiently write her own notes, but also giving her a sense of independence she had lost over the years. This project was 1 of 50 nominated for the National IDeA Accessibility Competition for its unique approach. Currently, I am a Co-founder of a small med-tech startup, Checkup, that is trying to modernize the acquisition of patient data for mental health physicians. This startup is currently in its early stages but we are in the process of writing our first paper on the impacts our application has had on the improvement of patient care.

These two examples are ideas that came up from being inquisitive and pushing myself to learn as much as possible in both of these fields. Through resilience and an open mind, I hope to greatly impact: the way that health care data is used and also create modern software to solve important medical problems. 

Through fellowships like Kleiner Perkins, I will not only be able to further cultivate my technological skills, but I will be able to network with highly perfomant students my age and titans of the tech industry. Such a fellowship would be a quite impactful on how I create ventures in the future as well as correct course for ones I have already started. Additionally, I believe I would be able to bring a unique perspective to the fellowship due to the program I am in and the exctracurriculars I participate in. I have heard amazing stories about the experiences of students in this fellowship and I cannot wait to have a similar experience myself!
